# **Hybrid Recommendation System**  

This project presents the design and implementation of a hybrid recommendation system that combines various approaches to deliver accurate and personalized recommendations.  

## **Overview**  
The system integrates the following components:  
1. **High Utility Itemset Mining (EIHI):**  
   - Utilizes the EIHI model to optimize the mining process by reducing the search space and improving data processing efficiency.  

2. **Combination of CB, CF, and HUI Models:**  
   - Employs algorithms such as KNN, User-Based, Item-Based, and SVD to enhance recommendation quality and accuracy.  

3. **Graph Neural Networks (GNN):**  
   - Leverages complex graph features and real-world product values to further optimize recommendations and enhance user experiences.  

## **Features**  
- **Data Optimization:** Efficient processing through High Utility Itemset Mining.  
- **Accuracy:** Enhanced precision with CB, CF, and collaborative HUI methods.  
- **Personalization:** Flexible and user-focused recommendations.  
- **Modern Techniques:** Integration of GNN to utilize graph-based insights.  

## **Benefits**  
- Improved system accuracy.  
- Enhanced flexibility to meet diverse user needs.  
- Scalable and robust architecture for real-world applications.

### Experimental Results  

The hybrid recommendation system was evaluated on accuracy, revenue, and the impact of integrating High Utility Itemset Mining (HUI).  

- **Accuracy:**  
  - SVD achieved the best accuracy with the lowest RMSE (0.9125), followed by User-Based and Item-Based models.  
  - Content KNN showed the lowest accuracy, limited by its reliance on textual descriptions.  

- **Revenue:**  
  - HUI integration significantly boosted revenue across all models.  
  - Item-Based + HUI recorded the highest revenue (41.35 GBP), with an increase of 21.29 GBP.  

- **GNN Performance:**  
  - GNN + HUI reduced cross-entropy error but showed a slight trade-off in accuracy, highlighting optimization opportunities.  

HUI integration demonstrated clear improvements in both accuracy and revenue, validating its effectiveness in enhancing recommendation systems.
