# **Hybrid Recommendation System**  

This project presents the design and implementation of a hybrid recommendation system that combines various approaches to deliver accurate and personalized recommendations.  

## **Overview**  
The system integrates the following components:  
1. **High Utility Itemset Mining (EIHI):**  
   - Utilizes the EIHI model to optimize the mining process by reducing the search space and improving data processing efficiency.  

2. **Combination of CB, CF, and HUI Models:**  
   - Employs algorithms such as KNN, User-Based, Item-Based, and SVD to enhance recommendation quality and accuracy.  

3. **Graph Neural Networks (GNN):**  
   - Leverages complex graph features and real-world product values to further optimize recommendations and enhance user experiences.  

## **Features**  
- **Data Optimization:** Efficient processing through High Utility Itemset Mining.  
- **Accuracy:** Enhanced precision with CB, CF, and collaborative HUI methods.  
- **Personalization:** Flexible and user-focused recommendations.  
- **Modern Techniques:** Integration of GNN to utilize graph-based insights.  

## **Benefits**  
- Improved system accuracy.  
- Enhanced flexibility to meet diverse user needs.  
- Scalable and robust architecture for real-world applications.  

## **Getting Started**  
- Clone the repository:  
  ```bash  
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git  
  ```  
- Follow the setup instructions to run the hybrid recommendation system.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- High Utility Itemset Mining (EIHI)  
- Content-Based (CB) and Collaborative Filtering (CF)  
- Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
